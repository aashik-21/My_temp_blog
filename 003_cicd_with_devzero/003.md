## setting up ci/cd into devzero
    - https://docs.devzero.io/docs/how-to-guides/ci/run-github-actions-in-a-devbox
    - you will have a video link in here

- create a devzero account and  connect it over terminal first
- scroll up the above link to find the following code



# Note :  Run these command one at a time
- else you will mess it up
```
# Create a folder
mkdir actions-runner && cd actions-runner# Download the latest runner package
# download the binary
curl -o actions-runner-linux-x64-2.319.0.tar.gz -L https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.319.0/actions-runner-linux-x64-2.319.0.tar.gz
# Optional: Validate the hash
echo "52b8f9c5abb1a47cc506185a1a20ecea19daf0d94bbf4ddde7e617e7be109b14  actions-runner-linux-x64-2.319.0.tar.gz" | shasum -a 256 -c
# Extract the installer
tar xzf ./actions-runner-linux-x64-2.319.0.tar.gz
```

- after pasting the  above code
    - go to your github -> repo -> settings -> actions -> runners ->  new runner -> linux -> and copy paste the .configure
    - press enter for default settings

- go to devzero link above and copy and paste 
```
sudo ./svc.sh install root && sudo ./svc.sh start
```
- its different in github actions runner

- after this, if you go to the runners, you will be able to see idle state for the  vm

- update your yaml file 
```
runs-on: self-hosted
```

- so every time you push to git, it will automatically push to the  vm too
