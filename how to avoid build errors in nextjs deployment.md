Vercel is failing your build because **TypeScript + ESLint checks are running during `next build`**.
If you just want to **skip linting/type-checking in Vercel**, you have a few options:

---

### ✅ Option 1: Disable ESLint in Next.js build

Inside your `next.config.js`, add:

```js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  eslint: {
    ignoreDuringBuilds: true, // 👈 disables ESLint in build
  },
  typescript: {
    ignoreBuildErrors: true, // 👈 disables TypeScript type errors in build
  },
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
```

This way, Vercel will still build your project even if ESLint/TS errors exist.

---

### ✅ Option 2: Skip lint manually in `package.json`

Edit your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "next build --no-lint"
}
```

Or remove `lint` from the build pipeline if you’ve added it.

---

### ✅ Option 3: Disable ESLint completely in Vercel

Create a `.env` file (or add to Vercel environment variables):

```env
NEXT_DISABLE_ESLINT=1
```

---

⚠️ **Note**: Skipping linting and type-checking will let deployment succeed, but real bugs may sneak into production. It’s usually better to fix at least the critical ones.

---

👉 Do you want me to give you the **minimal config (just copy-paste)** so that Vercel ignores both **TypeScript** and **ESLint** checks, and your deploy always succeeds?
