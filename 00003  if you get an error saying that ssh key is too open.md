The error is because your private key file `ssh-key-2025-08-24.key` has **too open permissions** (`0664`).

SSH requires private key files to be readable **only by you**, not by group or others.

### Fix:

Run this in your terminal:

```bash
chmod 600 ssh-key-2025-08-24.key
```

This sets permissions so that **only you (the owner) can read/write** the key.

### Then retry SSH:

```bash
ssh -i ssh-key-2025-08-24.key ubuntu@140.245.235.255
```

It should work now ✅.

Would you like me to also show you how to permanently add this key to your `~/.ssh/config` so you don’t have to type `-i ssh-key-2025-08-24.key` every time?
