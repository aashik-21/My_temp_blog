Did you mean: An environment file is configured but terminal environment injection is disabled. Enable "python.terminal.sEndFile" to use environment variables from .env files in terminals.

AI Overview
To enable the use of environment variables from .env files in terminals within Visual Studio Code, the python.terminal.useEnvFile setting needs to be enabled. This setting allows the Python extension to inject environment variables defined in your .env file into the integrated terminal sessions.
Here are the steps to enable python.terminal.useEnvFile:
Open VS Code Settings:
Go to File > Preferences > Settings (on Windows/Linux).
Go to Code > Preferences > Settings (on macOS).
Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+, (or Cmd+, on macOS).
Search for the Setting:
In the search bar at the top of the Settings tab, type python.terminal.useEnvFile.
Enable the Setting:
Locate the "Python > Terminal: Use Env File" setting.
Check the box next to this setting to enable it.
After enabling this setting, any new integrated terminals you open within VS Code will automatically load environment variables from the .env file located in your workspace's root directory (or a parent directory, if configured). This allows your terminal sessions to access the variables defined in your .env file, which is particularly useful for managing sensitive information like API keys or database credentials without hardcoding them into your scripts.
